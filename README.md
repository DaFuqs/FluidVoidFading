### Renders fluids smoothly flowing into the void, instead of being cut instantly, making sky type worlds look much nicer and dynamic.

A **must-have for every Skyblock pack** or packs featuring dimensions up in the sky, **clientside only**!

## Notable Features
- client-only required
- automatic compat with all modded fluids

## Comparison: With and Without Fluid Void Fading
By default, fluids flowing into the bottom of the world will get cut up harshly, leaving a ugly floating block behind
With Fluid Void Fading added, it gets a transparent tail as it smoothly blends into nothingness

## Troubleshooting
Should a Fluid not render transparent (it's texture is not transparent by default, like lava), add its name to the configuration file
